# Simple Recommender

Simple recommenders are basic systems that recommends the top items based on a certain metric or score.

The following are the steps involved:

* Decide on the metric or score to rate movies on.
* Calculate the score for every movie.
* Sort the movies based on the score and output the top results.

# Content-based recommender

Content based recommenders suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
